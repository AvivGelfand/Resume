# Summary

- 1st year MSc candidate in Data Science (HUJI); Thesis: Dimensionality reduction of Deep Learning problem space through statistical methods and graph theory. BSc in Statistics and Data Science (HUJI; GPA 89)
- Dedicated to long-term growth in a cutting-edge company with a positive atmosphere; available for 80%-100% time role as a Data Scientist / ML or AI Researcher / Engineer / SW Dev.
- Demonstrated success in AI and software development through academic/private projects and roles, with a track record of implementing machine learning models to solve complex problems requiring strong collaboration and rapid self-learning skills, consistently delivering efficient and accurate models.
# Experience

## The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, NLP Data Scientist / Research Assistant

- Oct 2023 – May 2024
- Successfully executed a Supervised-Fine-Tuning training of large language models to classify defendant arguments in trials for a broader statistical legal research project; reduced labeling time and errors, replacing manual tagging with LLM-based tagging.
- Drove strategic alignment by delivering situational analyses and action plans to US-based stakeholders, effectively prioritizing objectives and focusing efforts to meet deadlines.
- Dealt with significant imbalance using embedded cluster stratified sampling methods. Corrected errors in the labeled data. Reached over 90% accuracy and 80% F1 scores in most target labels. Substantially reduced model complexity and training time using efficient sampling.
- Acquired all relevant knowledge in PyTorch and LLMs through fully independent learning, unguided.
- Presented findings at a prominent statistics and data science conference in May 2024.

## Upscale Analytics, Statistics & Machine Learning Instructor

- Oct 2022 – Sept 2023
- Built dozens of ML hands-on projects for a Machine Learning and Statistical Inference course, with constant feedback from a Senior Data Scientist (and head lecturer), Michael Winer.
- Instructed data analysts through their first steps in statistical inference and classic machine learning$:$ linear and logistic regressions, ensemble learners such as random forests & XGBoost, and clustering methods.
- Advanced from teaching assistant to instructor, then to a partner role. 3 successful semesters of weekly TA sessions with a significant presence of students.

## The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Research & Development Assistant

- Apr 2022 – Mar 2023
- Self-taught and programmed smart contracts with a C++-based programming language; developed simulations interface using react.js.
- Designed and analyzed online surveys; conducted literature and academic peer reviews. Web-scraped data monthly.

## Israel Defense Forces, Data Analyst & Research Team Leader

- Dec 2018 – Dec 2020
- Conducted research, assessments, and analytics for high-ranked decision-makers. Triplicated, updated, and maintained strategic databases while collaborating with programmers and economists.
- Led cross-organizational projects resulting in several two in-depth research papers with an unprecedented scale of collaboration between two research branches.

# Education

## The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, MSc in Statistics & Data Science

- Oct 2023 – July 2026
- Thesis on Dimensionality Reduction in Deep Learning (LLMs focused), guided by Prof. Ariel Jaffe.

## The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, BSc in Statistics & Data Science

- Oct 2021 – Aug 2024
- GPA: 89 ; Also completed 33% of the required courses for master's degree while working in several roles.
