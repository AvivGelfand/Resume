# Experience

## The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, NLP Data Scientist / Research Assistant

- Oct 2023 – present
- Fine-tuned (SFT) Large Language models for a US-Israeli statistical legal research team, classified arguments in trial records.
- Applied LORA, PEFT, text cleaning, and statistical methods.
- Dealt with the significant imbalance and noisy labels and features, using embedded cluster stratified sampling methods and an iterative active learning approach.
- Corrected errors in the labeled data.
- Reached over .90 accuracy and over .80 F1 scores in most target labels, over 20% improvement from the initial benchmark.
- Utilized the university's Cluster resources (with Linux) to fine-tune open-source foundational models with PyTorch Lightning.
- Acquired all relevant knowledge in PyTorch and LLMs with nothing but a laptop and the Internet.
- Presented my work at the annual Israel Statistics and Data Science Association conference in May 2024.

## Upscale Analytics, Statistics & Machine Learning Teaching Assistant

- Oct 2022 – present
- Built and taught dozens of machine-learning projects in the company's course, with constant feedback from a Senior Data Scientist (and head lecturer), Michael Winer.
- Instructed data analysts through their first steps in Statistical Inference and Classic Machine learning linear and logistic regressions, ensemble learners (random forests & XGBoost), clustering with K-means, and DBSCAN.
- Advanced from teaching assistant to instructor, then to a partner role. 3 successful semesters of weekly TA sessions with a significant presence of students.

## The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Research & Development Assistant

- Apr 2022 – Mar 2023
