        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>1st year MSc candidate in Data Science (HUJI); Thesis: Dimensionality reduction of Deep Learning problem space through statistical methods and graph theory. BSc in Statistics and Data Science (HUJI; GPA 89).</li>
        <li>Dedicated to long-term growth in a cutting-edge company with a positive atmosphere; available for 80%-100% time role as a Data Scientist / ML or AI Researcher / Engineer / SW Dev.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated success in AI and software development through numerous roles and projects over the past 8 years, with a track record of implementing machine learning models to solve complex problems requiring strong collaboration and rapid self-learning skills, consistently delivering efficient and accurate models.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <h2>Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Dr. Adi Leibovitch's Quantitative Legal Research lab, NLP Data Scientist / Research Assistant</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Oct 2023 – May 2024</li>
        <li>Successfully executed Supervised-Fine-Tuning of large language models (frameworks$:$ PyTorch, Transformers) to classify arguments in trials for a broader statistical legal research project; reduced labeling time and errors, replacing manual tagging with LLM-based tagging.</li>
        <li>Drove strategic alignment by delivering situational analyses and action plans to US-based stakeholders, effectively prioritizing objectives and focusing efforts to meet deadlines.</li>
        <li>Reached over 90% accuracy and 80% F1 scores in most target labels. Substantially reduced model complexity and training time using efficient sampling and overcoming significant imbalance. Corrected errors in the labeled data.</li>
        <li>Presented findings and achievements at a prominent statistics and data science conference in May 2024.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Upscale Analytics, Statistics &amp; Machine Learning Instructor</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Oct 2022 – Sept 2023</li>
        <li>Built dozens of ML hands-on projects for a Machine Learning and Statistical Inference course, with constant feedback from a Senior Data Scientist (and head lecturer), Michael Winer. Instructed data analysts in tech through their first steps in statistical inference and classic machine learning using Scikit-Learn, SciPy, and XGBoost Libraries.</li>
        <li>Advanced from teaching assistant to instructor, then to a partner role. 3 successful semesters of weekly TA sessions with a significant presence of students.</li>
