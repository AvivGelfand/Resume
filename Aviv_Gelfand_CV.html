        <h1>RenderCV Pipeline</h1>
        <p>Are you ready to revolutionize the way you manage and craft your CVs and resumes?</p>
        <p>Picture this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>You simply update your <code>src/John_Doe_CV.yaml</code> input file and push the changes.</li>
        <li>Then, a pipeline generates a new PDF and Markdown from it and uploads it to the repository.</li>
        <li>When you are done with your work, you can create a new release on GitHub, tagging your CV with something like <code>v2024.04</code>. The pipeline will automatically add the PDF and its $\LaTeX$ source as assets to the release.</li>
        <li>You have successfully created your CV pipeline, and all the history is in safe hands and reproducible.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>How to start?</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=rendercv-pipeline&amp;template_owner=sinaatalay">Click here</a> to create your CV repository based on this <code>rendercv-pipeline</code> template repository.</li>
        <li>
        <p>Edit either</p>
        <ul>
        <li>the <code>src/John_Doe_CV.yaml</code> file, or</li>
        <li>the contents of <code>src/markdown</code> or <code>src/classic</code> directories</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and push. Then, see the magic happen.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Some tips</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv">RenderCV</a> to understand what you can do with this tool.</li>
        <li>Edit and preview your CV in your browser without installing anything by creating a codespace. Click the &lt;&gt; <strong>Code</strong> button, then click the <strong>Codespaces</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Create codespace on main</strong>. The environment will be ready for RenderCV usage. Update <code>.vscode/launch.json</code> to point to your YAML file and press <code>F5</code> to run RenderCV in the browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>As a third-year BSc / first-year MSc student in Statistics and Data Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I possess an intense intellectual curiosity. My passion for learning has driven me to develop technical expertise in Python, machine learning, deep learning, and big data processing.</p>
        <p>However, what I find most fulfilling is sharing my knowledge and fostering understanding. Whether as a teaching assistant, instructor or through team collaboration and brainstorming with colleagues, I strive to break down complex topics and facilitate a better grasp of intricate concepts.</p>
        <p>My interdisciplinary perspective, which combines a mathematical and statistical background with programming proficiency and some marketing experience, allows me to tackle problems with scientific rigor, attention to detail, and a methodical mindset. Drawing insights from diverse fields, I approach challenges from multiple angles.</p>
        <p>As I pursue cutting-edge research in Data Science and AI, I desire to contribute to advancing knowledge in these fields and ensure that it is applied responsibly for the betterment of humanity. I am eager to join an innovative organization where I can continue to learn, share my knowledge, and make a meaningful impact while leveraging my interdisciplinary mindset and commitment to scientific rigor.</p>
        <p>In addition to my on-campus learning, I am independently gaining experience and knowledge in ML, DL, Gen AI, and automation through various research roles and freelance projects.</p>
        <p>I am all ears if you have an exciting data science project or a role for me!</p>
