    experience:
      - company: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
        position: NLP Data Scientist / Research Assistant
        start_date: 2023-10
        end_date: 2024-05
        highlights:
          - Successfully executed a Supervised-Fine-Tuning training of large language models to classify defendant arguments in trials for a broader statistical legal research project; reduced labeling time and errors, replacing manual tagging with LLM-based tagging.
          - Drove strategic alignment by delivering situational analyses and action plans to US-based stakeholders, [effectively prioritizing objectives](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uaPqIVpnyhM14W7Rt5BT14hfQOLjpTcVgMVK71eRwtE/edit?usp=sharing) and focusing efforts to meet deadlines.
          - Dealt with significant imbalance using embedded cluster stratified sampling methods. Corrected errors in the labeled data. Reached over 90% accuracy and 80% F1 scores in most target labels. Substantially reduced model complexity and training time using efficient sampling.
          - Acquired all relevant knowledge in PyTorch and LLMs through fully independent learning, unguided.
          - [Presented findings](https://github.com/AvivGelfand/Fine-tuning-Large-Language-Models) at a prominent statistics and data science conference in May 2024.
